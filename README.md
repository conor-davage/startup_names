# startup_names

I was interested to understand if there are any trends happening with how people name their startups. I notifed that many new companities tend to re-use endings like 'ful' 'ible' like Contenful and Audible.

To do this I scraped all the h1 name tags from the website https://www.startups-list.com/.

You can download the startup dataset to use in your project.
